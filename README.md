# RASAPCompSciA

Welcome to RAS Computer Science A: student guide!

## What this includes

This repository will have different documented codes written for assignments.
Feel free to use them, but try to modify things like the names of variables to avoid teacher suspicion.

## Contributing

As there will be changes to the course each year, I hope users of this repository will help update the different codes and then pass them down to the next generation.
Thanks for using!
