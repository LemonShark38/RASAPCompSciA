# RASAPCompSciA

Welcome to RAS Computer Science A: student guide!

## What this includes

This repository will have different documented codes written for assignments.
Feel free to use them, but try to modify things like the names of variables to avoid teacher suspicion.

## How to use

Each branch in this repository (Excluding main) is for an activity or project.
Specific details will be in the ReadMe file of the branch.

Please do not pull branches to main, as it will mess things up.

Most of the time, the class name will be the same. Do not change the class name nor the file name when using the code.
Please don't blindly copy and paste; Required code may be slightly different from the code we have published.

## Contributing
Make a new branch for each activity; do not add on to a previous activity or main.
If the change is on an existing activity, please push it there.
Please include details on what were added/removed to avoid confusion and trolling.

As there will be changes to the course each year, I hope users of this repository will help update the different codes and then pass them down to the next generation.
Thanks for using!
